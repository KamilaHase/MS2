# VOCAB - MEMORIZE
A game to test visual memory and at the same time viewers ability to learn new vocabulary words. The rules are: look at the newly presented 6 vocabulary words that are in English and in Czech language. Try to memorize as many as you can. Observe the image presented and memorize location of each word. You will have 40 seconds for this, when the time is over, a new image appears with missing areas. There are 2 randomly picked words (from the previous 6) and you are supposed to say where does each of the words belong to the image. You can check your succes by clicking on "Check answer", you can also get new 2 randomly picked words (to test your memory again) or you can go back to the front page to read instructions again.

The aim of this game is to help people who are learning new languages develop their vocabulary in a playfull way. It is especially developed for people with visual memory who associate the learning material to images and later on are reminded of the actual image and the newly learned content. 

The interactions that is offered to the user are developed in two ways according to their device. First version is for larger screens - laptops and computers where the user is encouraged to actually grab the new words and find their correct location on presented image. For touch screen there is a "fill in" version. The main image contains numbers where items were erased and the user is supposed to write in a number, where the randomly picked word belongs.

The presented game is a trial, or an example of a possible more expanded version with many images and different vocabulary words.
The game is currently developed for learning vocabulary in Czech language but can be easily adapted to more languages.


Requires some user
## UX
As mentioned, the game is developed as an example of an expanded version so in that case there would be many more user´s expectations, or reasons why to use this game and come back to it. However in this ReadMe file I will be describing only the actual current version of website that now exists. 
### User stories:
  - Expected goals of first time page visitors:
    1. English speaking people who want to give a try to learning a new language.
    2. English speaking people who want to test their visual memory.
    3. English speaking people who are curious about difficulty of the Czech language and want to test if they are capable of learning a few words.
    4. English speaking people who already know the Czech language and only want to test or refresh their skills. 
    5. Czech speaking people who want to check their knowledge of few English words and mostly test their visual memory. 
    6. Anybody that wants to check the type of game there is.

### Design of the website:
#### Typography
- The text on website is on purpose as short as possible in order to lead focus on the actual game and actions there. Therefore there is one main font to provide unite effect: 'Allerta Stencil'.
- The main page contains also instructions (longer text) and to provide better user experience, for longer text is used font 'Roboto' ('Allerta Stencil' is kept only for headings, buttons and footer).
Both fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts").

#### Colors
There are two color schemes on the website. 
First is to provide certain branding of Vocab-Memorize and is represented on index.html page. The colors are based on turquise color in combination with white and red (mainly on images).
Branding color are:
- font: #04bc89, 
- background color supporting the overall brand look: #116661, 
- and white color of fonts and background: #FFFFFF. 
All other branding colors are variants of the above.

Second color scheme is developed to fit the main-hero house image and its colors. This color scheme might be changed if game is further developed and more images are added. There are also drops of the branding colors used on the game section pages in order to unify the overall look and remind the user it all belongs together to the same game.
Colors used for game sections are:
- instructions, buttons, timer: #0c93d1,
- cards font: #ea515b,
- action buttons - check, new words, try again: #f80707, #fda23e, #0a4b69.
- background colors are picked as variants of white in accordance to the page: #f5f5f5, #f5edee.
- check answers button triggers showing the results - font, areas showing correct answers - and is designed to support to branding of Vocab-Memorize, therefore it´s actions colors are based on #04bc89.
All other colors are variants of the above.
